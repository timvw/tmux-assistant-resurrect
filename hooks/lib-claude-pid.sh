# Shared helper for Claude hooks — finds the main Claude process PID.
# Sourced by claude-session-track.sh and claude-session-cleanup.sh.
#
# Claude may spawn hooks via an intermediate process (e.g., sh -c 'bash hook.sh'),
# so $PPID is not necessarily the main Claude process. This walks up the process
# tree to find the ancestor whose command is 'claude'.

# Walk up the process tree from $PPID to find the main Claude process.
# On some systems $PPID IS the Claude PID; on others there's an intermediate
# shell (sh -c) between Claude and the hook.
